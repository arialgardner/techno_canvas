# Guest Log Feature

A draggable modal component that allows users to leave messages in a scrollable guest book, similar to a hotel guest log.

  - "Xm ago" (< 1 hour)
  - "Xh ago" (< 24 hours)
  - "Xd ago" (< 7 days)
  - Full date (older)

## Implementation Details

### Component Location
- **File:** `ui/src/components/GuestLog.vue`
- **Integration:** `ui/src/views/DashboardView.vue`

### Firestore Collection
- **Collection:** `guestLog`
- **Document Fields:**
  ```javascript
  {
    message: string,        // 1-280 characters
    userId: string,         // Creator's user ID
    userName: string,       // Creator's display name
    createdAt: timestamp,   // Server timestamp
    timestamp: number       // Client timestamp (for sorting)
  }
  ```

### Security Rules
- All authenticated users can **read** entries
- Users can only **create** entries with their own `userId`
- Messages must be 1-280 characters
- **No updates or deletes** allowed (permanent log)

### Rate Limiting Logic
1. Tracks last entry timestamps in client-side array
2. Filters out entries older than 60 seconds
3. Counts remaining entries (max 2)
4. Calculates cooldown based on oldest entry
5. Updates countdown timer every second
6. Disables input during cooldown
