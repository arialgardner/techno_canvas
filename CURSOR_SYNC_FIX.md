# Cursor Sync Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified

The cursor syncing between users was completely broken due to a critical architecture issue:

**Root Cause:** The cursor tracking was listening to `mousemove` events on the `canvasWrapper` DIV element, but the Konva `<v-stage>` (which sits inside the wrapper) was capturing all mouse events. The stage prevented mouse events from bubbling up to the wrapper's listener, so cursor positions were never being tracked or broadcast.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Integrated Cursor Tracking into Stage Mouse Events

**Modified Files:**
- `ui/src/composables/useCanvasMouseEvents.js`
- `ui/src/views/CanvasView.vue`

**Changes:**
- Added `onCursorMove` callback parameter to `useCanvasMouseEvents`
- Modified `handleMouseMove` to call the cursor tracking callback on every mouse movement
- Removed old canvas wrapper event listeners for cursor tracking
- Simplified `handleCursorMove` to only need canvas coordinates (no longer needs pointer extraction)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Cursor tracking via wrapper DOM element (never triggered)
canvasWrapper.value.addEventListener('mousemove', handleCursorMove)
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Cursor tracking integrated into stage mouse handler
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  // ... calculate canvas coordinates ...
  
  // Track cursor position for other users (always, regardless of tool/state)
  if (onCursorMove && user.value) {
    onCursorMove(canvasX, canvasY)
  }
  
  // ... rest of mouse move logic ...
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging

**Modified File:**
- `ui/src/composables/useCursorsRTDB.js`

**Added Logs:**
- When cursor positions are sent to RTDB
- When cursor updates are received from RTDB
- When cursors are added/removed from the map
- Connection and subscription status

**Example Logs:**
```
[Cursor] Sent position for UserName: (250, 150) on canvas: canvas123
[Cursor] Subscribing to cursors for canvas: canvas123, currentUserId: user456
[Cursor] Received cursor update, total cursors: 2
[Cursor] Processing cursor for user: user789, position: (300, 200)
[Cursor] Cursors map now has 1 cursors
```

### 3. Verified Configuration

**Database Rules (`database.rules.json`):**
✅ Properly configured with:
- Read access: `auth != null`
- Write access: `auth != null && auth.uid == $userId`
- Validation for cursor data structure (x, y, userName, timestamp)
- Bounds checking for coordinates (-10000 to 20000)

**Firebase Config (`ui/src/firebase/config.js`):**
✅ Configured to use:
- `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Properly initializes `realtimeDB` using `getDatabase(app)`

**Feature Flag (`ui/src/utils/featureFlags.js`):**
✅ `USE_REALTIME_DB` is set to `true` (line 16)
- App uses `useCursorsRTDB()` instead of `useCursors()`

## How It Works Now

1. **Mouse Movement:** User moves mouse over Konva stage
2. **Stage Handler:** `handleMouseMove` in `useCanvasMouseEvents` receives the event
3. **Cursor Callback:** Calls `onCursorMove(canvasX, canvasY)` with canvas coordinates
4. **Update RTDB:** `handleCursorMove` calls `updateCursorPosition` (throttled at 16-50ms)
5. **Broadcast:** Position written to Firebase Realtime Database at `canvases/{canvasId}/cursors/{userId}`
6. **Receive Updates:** Other users subscribed to same path receive updates via `onValue` listener
7. **Interpolation:** CursorInterpolator smoothly animates cursor movements
8. **Render:** UserCursor components display other users' cursors on screen

## Testing Instructions

### To Test Cursor Syncing:

1. **Verify Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # Check that VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL is set in your .env file
   grep VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL ui/.env
   ```

2. **Open Two Browser Windows:**
   - Window 1: Log in as User A
   - Window 2: Log in as User B (different account or incognito mode)

3. **Navigate to Same Canvas:**
   - Both users should open the same canvas URL

4. **Move Mouse:**
   - In Window 1, move mouse around the canvas
   - In Window 2, you should see User A's cursor moving in real-time
   - Vice versa

5. **Check Console Logs:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for `[Cursor]` prefixed messages
   - You should see:
     - `Sent position for [username]: (x, y)`
     - `Received cursor update, total cursors: X`
     - `Processing cursor for user: [userId]`

### Expected Behavior:

✅ Cursors appear within <50ms of movement  
✅ Smooth interpolation between positions  
✅ Cursors disappear when user leaves canvas  
✅ Auto-cleanup on disconnect  
✅ No duplicate cursors (own cursor not shown)  

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Missing Environment Variable:**
   - If `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` is not set, RTDB won't connect
   - Check `.env` file in `ui/` directory

2. **Database Rules Not Deployed:**
   - Run: `firebase deploy --only database`
   - Verify rules are active in Firebase Console

3. **Authentication Issues:**
   - Users must be authenticated (`auth != null`)
   - Check that both users are logged in

4. **Different Canvas IDs:**
   - Ensure both users are on the exact same canvas
   - Check URL: `/canvas/{canvasId}`

## Files Modified

1. `ui/src/composables/useCanvasMouseEvents.js` - Added onCursorMove callback
2. `ui/src/views/CanvasView.vue` - Integrated cursor tracking with stage events
3. `ui/src/composables/useCursorsRTDB.js` - Added debug logging

## Files Verified (No Changes Needed)

1. `database.rules.json` - Rules are correct
2. `ui/src/firebase/config.js` - RTDB initialization is correct
3. `ui/src/utils/featureFlags.js` - Feature flag is enabled

## Performance Characteristics

- **Send Throttle:** 16ms (active movement) to 50ms (idle)
- **Small Move Suppression:** Movements <5px are ignored
- **Target Latency:** <50ms cursor sync
- **Auto-cleanup:** Stale cursors removed every 10 seconds
- **Disconnect Cleanup:** Cursors removed automatically on disconnect

## Next Steps

1. Test with two users on the same canvas
2. Monitor console logs for any errors
3. If issues persist, check Firebase Console for RTDB connection status
4. Verify that `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` is set correctly

The cursor syncing should now work correctly!
